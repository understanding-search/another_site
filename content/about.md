We are planning our next research sprint in AI Safety Camp. If you want to join us, please submit your application via the [AI Safety Camp website](https://aisafety.camp/) - You can see our current round of research proposals on the [AISC Agenda Page](https://unsearch.org/aisc). In addition to joining our research sprint, we greatly encourage others to use, and contribute, the [libraries we have developed](https://github.com/understanding-search) for our research.

We plan to hire team members for future research projects. You can leave your email address [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnUADqEuI3BYqnTMkNK6OPgIFJMZ_BNbjS6OdwEIVnfedmsA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we'll keep you updated on upcoming opportunities. 

You can also contact us at [team@unsearch.org](mailto:team@unsearch.org) if you have any questions or comments.
